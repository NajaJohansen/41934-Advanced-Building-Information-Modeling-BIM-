## Introduction
Our tool aims to extract the necessary information from an IFC file to perform a life cycle analysis of an entire building. The tool also identifies potential modeling errors that could affect the outcomes of the LCA and should be fixed. However, the tool is only a proof of concept and focuses only on the doors rather than on all building components of a building. 

In this section we provide a brief reflection on our learning experience, the process of developing the tutorial and the feedback received, our future as advanced users of OpenBIM, and finally, a conclusion of the process. 


## Our learning experience
Over the course, we have gained valuable knowledge in OpenBIM, which allows us to progress in our roles. We started the course as modelers since we had experience modeling buildings and exporting data using closed and native BIM software, such as Revit. However, exporting data using a closed software is a manual process and it is difficult to identify modeling mistakes. In this course, we have learned how to automate the process of exporting data and identify modeling mistakes using OpenBIM. 

Nevertheless, there is still a lot to learn. In this process, we have struggled to find the correct commands to extract specific data from the IFC file and there was not much literature or resources available. Besides, our tool is a proof of concept that focuses only on the doors category; thus, there is still room for improvement to deliver a realistic tool that includes all building components. It is important to mention that we have not modified the IFC file because it was not relevant to our tool. This was also discussed with the professors. Moreover, the tool does not focus on matching the materials extracted from the IFC model from the materials library of the LCA software. Including this feature could add value to our tool.  

Throughout this process, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of OpenBIM and we can see all the possibilities it offers. We recognized OpenBIM as a relevant tool for process optimization. It has the potential to automate traditional workflows, saving valuable time and mitigating the risk of human errors. Indeed, the tool that we have developed could already be relevant for one of our group membersâ€™ student jobs. Overall, we see the need for using OpenBIM in the future. 


## Our process of developing the tutorial
Based on the course structure and assignments, it could have been beneficial to include some smaller tasks or tutorials at the beginning of the course. This way, the entire class could have gained insight into what OpenBIM is more quickly, rather than having to learn it individually along the way.

On the other hand, having the choice of our own use case has been fun. It kept the group motivated, and the interest in the project remained strong. Additionally, selecting a use case directly related to the group's work experiences and interests made it more realistic.

It was exciting to primarily work with BlenderBIM. This allowed us to focus exclusively on this software. However, we felt that there was a need for more instruction on how BlenderBIM function, and as mentioned earlier, small tutorials or tasks could have been relevant here. This way, we could have delved even deeper into the tool within the short duration of the course. Therefore, we believe it was appropriate to work with one tool. Nevertheless, it could have also been interesting to explore other tools instead of just being introduced to them.

## Our feedback from the tutorial
The tool effectively addressed the identified use case, providing valuable feedback through explanations and a significant contribution in the form of the error file. This feedback mechanism enhances the tool's utility for Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) consultants with limited BIM modeling and programming knowledge. The tool's focus on doors within the proof of concept is evident, aiming at extracting materials and quantities of information from an IFC file. The valuable output, specifically the "Output_file_1_Errors," highlights discrepancies in door dimensions and material information, facilitating prompt issue identification for future LCA calculations. However, there's an opportunity for improvement by expanding the tool's coverage to include all building components, that way enabling a more comprehensive LCA.
 
The use case was well modeled for its intended audience of BIM modelers, and suggests room for enhancement by allowing users to modify rules, particularly those related to door sizes. This modification flexibility would cater to varying project requirements and further elevate the tool's applicability. Additionally, the scoping of the project is clear, aligning with the needs of BIM modelers, but emphasizing the potential for users to modify door-related rules could offer a more tailored experience.
 
In the context of the received feedback, the suggestion to make rules about doors more flexible aligns with the idea of allowing users to modify rules. Regarding the decision not to change the model based on the code, the explanation provides transparency by citing a conversation with the teacher. The rationale behind not adding an index number or exploring specific environmental impacts linked to materials is justified, given the specific focus on using LCAbyg with its dedicated environmental impact database.
 
In conclusion, while the tool has proven effective in its current state, opportunities for improvement include extending its coverage beyond doors, incorporating flexibility for users to modify rules, and addressing identified text errors. The decision not to change the model is well-justified, considering the project's specific focus on LCAbyg and its associated environmental impact database.

## Our future for advanced use of OpenBIM 
For our thesis, we're leaning towards other topics right now, so OpenBIM tools might not be the main focus. We're exploring different areas but recognize that OpenBIM tools could be useful in the wider context of the building industry.

Chances are we'll be using OpenBIM tools quite a bit in our professional life over the next 10 years. They're becoming more common, and we see them as handy tools for collaboration and getting data in building projects.
Since all of us have some experience with coding is likely that we will use OpenBIM in the future. 

## Conclusion 
This process has been a rewarding journey filled with valuable insights and practical learning experiences. One standout aspect has been the freedom to choose our case study based on our own interests and experience, which kept us motivated during the course.  Although we only have delivered a proof of concept, we see the benefit of always keeping a broad view of our tool. Besides, developing and improving the same use case during the course using different perspectives is an enriching exercise.  
Nevertheless, we see some areas of improvement. We believe the biggest difficulty was extracting specific data from the IFC file. Thus, we advise including more exercises or providing relevant resources to give students a small headstart. Although there was already a lecture from some external OpenBIM professionals, it could have been nice to have more examples of how OpenBIM is used in the industry.
