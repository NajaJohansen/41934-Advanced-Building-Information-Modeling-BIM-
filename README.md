<!-- 3A: Analyse use case -->
## 3A: Analyse use case

## 3B: Propose a (design for a) tool / workflow

## 3D: Value What is the potential improvement offered by this tool?

This is the common question when developing tools and processes as an intrapreneur in a company. You should consider the business and societal value of this tool – does it save time to the company, does it make employees happier / more productive? Could it reduce material use in society?

Describe the business value (How does it create value for your business/employer)
Describe the societal value (How does it make the world better)
N.B. If it doesn’t do either of these things (ideally it should do both - don’t do it!!)
