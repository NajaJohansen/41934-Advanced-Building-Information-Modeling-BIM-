## Introduction
- Explanation of the tool and purpose
- proof of concept
- Only focusing at the doors
Our tool extracts the necesary information of an IFC file in order to perform a life cycle analysis (LCA) of a buidling: materials and quantities. Besides, it identifies potential modelling errors (such as unrealistic dimensions or lack of material assignations) that could affect the outcomes of the LCA. This tool is a proof of concept and focus only on extracting information related to the doors of the building. A more detailed description of the tool can be found ....

This tutorial aims to target role level 1 (modeller). The tool is intended for LCA consultants with little knowledge on BIM modelling and programming. Also, we advise to check the the "video tutorial" (hyperlink) as a complementary material.
